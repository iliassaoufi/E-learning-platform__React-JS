# E-learning-platform__React-JS

I designed and developed some features for the E-Learning platform including :


- Building dynamic and interactive interfaces such as Quizzes and Skill Assessments with React JS.
- Developing a built in Code Editor on the platform using React.js, allowing learners to practice coding directly within the platform.
- Creating a dashboard for Analytics and Reporting with Char.JS to track learner progress, analyze course effectiveness.
- Working on track users' activities and interactions with the course's materials, providing insights into user behavior.

The complete documentation is coming soon
